# Covid19_data_analysis

In this portfolio, we'll delve into the nuances of data preparation and analysis. Starting with the preprocessing and merging of key datasets, we'll focus on fine-tuning the COVID19 dataset by eliminating specific columns and consolidating rows. Our exploration involves identifying meaningful metrics, merging datasets to discover underlying correlations, and ultimately visualizing our findings using the powerful Seaborn tool. This process aims to provide a clear understanding of our objectives, datasets, and the pertinent questions our analysis addresses.

## Dataset
We'll explore the COVID19 dataset from John Hopkins University, detailing daily confirmed cases by country. We'll also examine a global dataset on life factors rated by residents of each nation. Our goal is to merge these datasets and investigate any potential links between the virus's spread and the happiness of a country's inhabitants.

## Tasks
- Deleting useless columns from our dataset
- Aggregating the rows by the country
- Visualizing data related to a country for example China
- Calculating a good measure
- Calculating the first derivative of the curve
- Find maxmimum infection rate for China, Italy, and Spain
- Find maximum infection rate for all of the countries.
- Merging two datasets
- Finding and visualizing correlations between the maximum infection rate and other variables

## Conclusion
We can conclude based on the correlation between GDP per capita and maximum infection rates, that developed countries are more prone to getting the infection. We can also notice that the other variables such as Social support, Healthy life expectancy, Freedom to make life choices also have a postivie linear relationship with the maximum infection rates
